Business Key Parameter 
Loans Disbursed: 
In microfinance, Loans Disbursed refers to the total Amount or number of loans that a 
microfinance institution (MFI) has issued to borrowers during a specific period. It is a key 
metric used to measure the outreach and operational performance of the institution. 
Key Aspects of Loans Disbursed: 
1. Definition: 
a. Represents loans that have been approved, and processed, and the funds 
released to borrowers. 
b. Includes loans disbursed for various purposes like business, agriculture, 
education, or personal needs. 
2. Measurement: 
a. Number of Loans Disbursed: Tracks the total count of loan accounts 
disbursed. 
b. Amount of Loans Disbursed: Reflects the total monetary amount issued to 
borrowers. 
3. Time Period: 
a. Often reported quarterly, annually, or for a custom period to track 
performance trends. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Due : 
This refers to a loan installment or payment that is scheduled to be paid by a certain date. 
When the due date arrives, the borrower is expected to make the payment as per the 
agreed terms. 
Example: 
Schedule of a borrower with 6 month EMI Loan: 
Due Date Due Amount 
05-Jan-2024 1000 
05-Feb-2024 1000 
05-Mar-2024 1000 
05-Apr-2024 1000 
05-May-2024 1000

05-Jun-2024 1000 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Past Due / Overdue / Arrears : 
When a payment is not made by the due date, it becomes past due. This indicates that the 
borrower has missed the scheduled payment deadline. 
Overdue refers to any payment that has not been paid after the due date has passed. 
Example: 
Let’s say there are total 4 customers in a bank 
Borrowers Due Amount Paid Amount Overdue 
Lalita 1000 1000 0 
Narmada 2000 1900 100 
Chandana 1500 0 1500 
Sitara 2000 2000 0 
Total Overdue of the Bank = 0 + 100 + 1500 + 0 =2000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Days Past Due (DPD) : 
DPD (Days Past Due) is a key metric in microfinance used to measure the number of days a 
payment is overdue from its scheduled due date. 
DPD=Current Date−Due Date 
Example: 
Let’s Assume Current Date = 30-Nov-2024 
Borrowers Due Amont Due Date Paid

DPD Buckets: 
DPD Bucket in microfinance refers to the classification of overdue loans based on the 
number of Days Past Due (DPD). 
DPD buckets typically follow these ranges, though the exact classification may vary by 
institution: 
0 DPD (Current): 
Loans with no overdue payments. Borrowers are up to date with their repayments. 
1–30 DPD: 
Loans overdue by 1 to 30 days. These are in the early-stage delinquency bucket. 
31–60 DPD: 
Loans overdue by 31 to 60 days. These are considered medium-risk loans. 
61–90 DPD: 
Loans overdue by 61 to 90 days. These fall under high-risk delinquency. 
90+ DPD (Non-Performing Loans): 
Loans overdue by more than 90 days are typically classified as Non-Performing Assets 
(NPAs) or bad debts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
POS: 
Principal Outstanding refers to the remaining unpaid portion of the principal loan amount 
that a borrower owes to the lender (microfinance institution). It does not include interest, 
fees, or penalties, but only the unpaid part of the principal loan amount. 
Key Features of Principal Outstanding: 
➢ Dynamic Value: As borrowers make repayments, the principal outstanding 
decreases. 
➢ Excludes Interest: It represents the actual borrowed amount yet to be repaid, 
excluding interest accrued. 
➢ Basis for Interest Calculation: Many microfinance institutions calculate interest 
on the reducing balance of the principal outstanding.

Portfolio At Risk (PAR): 
Portfolio at Risk (PAR) is a key performance indicator in microfinance that measures the 
Amount of an MFI's principal loan portfolio that is at risk of default. It reflects the total 
outstanding principal balance of loans that are overdue (not paid on time) 
Key Features of PAR: 
1. Indicator of Risk: It shows the percentage of the loan portfolio that is not 
performing as expected. 
2. Time Sensitivity: PAR is calculated for different time periods, commonly PAR>30 
(loans overdue by more than 30 days), PAR>60, or PAR>90. 
3. Portfolio Quality: A higher PAR indicates a greater risk of non-repayment, signaling 
poor portfolio quality.

PAR SMA Bucket: 
In microfinance and banking, PAR SMA Buckets refer to the classification of overdue loans 
into specific categories based on the number of days the payments are overdue. SMA 
stands for Special Mention Account, which is used to identify accounts that show early 
signs of stress and may require intervention to prevent default. 
1. SMA-0 / PAR 1-30 (Early Warning): 
a. Loans overdue by 1–30 days. 
b. Indicates early signs of repayment stress. 
c. Borrowers may need follow-up or counseling to ensure payments are made 
on time. 
6 | Page 
 
2. SMA-1 / PAR 31-60 (Moderate Risk): 
a. Loans overdue by 31–60 days. 
b. Suggests borrowers are facing financial challenges that may lead to default. 
c. Requires stronger recovery efforts, such as reminders, field visits, or 
restructuring options. 
3. SMA-2 (High Risk) / PAR 61-90: 
a. Loans overdue by 61–90 days. 
b. Represents a significant risk of the loan becoming a Non-Performing Asset 
(NPA). 
c. At this stage, most institutions intensify recovery actions to prevent a total 
loss. 
4. NPA / PAR 90+(Non-Performing Asset): 
a. Loans overdue by 90+ days. 
b. These loans are considered in default and typically require write-offs, legal 
action, or other drastic measures. 
Regular / PAR 0 / Current: 
• Loans with no overdue payments. 
• Represents loans where borrowers are paying on time. 
• Ideally, the majority of the portfolio should be in this bucket. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Active Borrower(AB): 
In microfinance, an Active Borrower refers to a client who currently has at least one 
outstanding loan with the microfinance institution (MFI). Active borrowers are a key metric 
for understanding the operational scale and outreach of an MFI. 
Key Characteristics of Active Borrowers: 
1. Outstanding Loan: A borrower is considered active as long as they have not fully 
repaid their loan or have a valid agreement with the MFI. 
2. Excludes Fully Repaid Accounts: Borrowers who have fully settled their loans and 
are not currently engaged in any financial relationship with the MFI are not included. 
3. Includes Multiple Loans: If a borrower has more than one active loan, they are still 
counted as a single active borrower. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
7 | Page 
 
Active Loans: 
In microfinance, Active Loans refer to the total number of loan accounts that are currently 
active or outstanding. An active loan is any loan that has been disbursed and has not yet 
been fully repaid, including loans in good standing, overdue loans, or those in default. 
Key Characteristics of Active Loans: 
1. Loan Account Focus: 
a. Each loan account is counted separately, even if a single borrower has 
multiple active loans. 
2. Excludes Closed Loans: 
a. Loans that have been fully repaid or written off are not included in the count 
of active loans. 
3. Status: 
a. Active loans include accounts at various stages, such as: 
i. Loans under regular repayment. 
ii. Overdue loans. 
iii. Loans in the process of restructuring or recovery. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Difference Between Active Loans and Active Borrowers: 
• Active Loans: Focuses on the number of loan accounts. A single borrower with 
multiple loans contributes to multiple active loans. (Key identifier: LAN) 
• Active Borrowers: Counts unique borrowers, regardless of how many loans they 
hold. (Key identifier: CIF Id, Client ID, Borrower ID, CRN) 
 
Example: 
Client ID Loan Account Number POS 
1001 743292541245 0 
1001 753894612852 15,000

Active Loan = 5 
Active Borrower = 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Demand Amount: 
The Demand amount is the total unpaid EMI amount (Current + OD) need to be paid in a 
month or in a specific time period. 
Regular Demand: unpaid EMI in a current Month or in a specific time period. 
OD Demand: unpaid EMI of Previous Month or before specific time period  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Collection Amount: 
Collection Amount is the Total Amount Collected from borrowers regarding in a specific 
time Period. 
Regular Collection: Collection Regarding unpaid EMI in a current Month or in a specific 
time period. 
OD Collection: Collection Regarding unpaid EMI of Previous Month or before specific time 
period. 
Advance Collection: Advance Collection refers to payments made by borrowers ahead of 
their scheduled repayment due dates. 
Collection Rules: 
➢ Interest deducted first then principle amount deducted 
➢ If a person have more than 1 EMI due, then oldest EMI deducted first and so on. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Repayment Rate: 
In microfinance, the Repayment Rate is a key performance metric that measures the 
proportion of loan repayments collected within a specified period compared to the total 
amount due during that period exclude any advance payment.  
In Simple word, RR the proportion of total collection excluding any advance payment 
regarding Total demand within a specified time period including overdue demand. 
9 | Page 
 
 
Repayment Rate=((Total Amount Collected – Advance Collection if any) / 
Total Amount Due)×100 
Example: 
Total Demand and Total Collection of a Bank given Below: 
Total Demand Total Collection Repayment Rate 
1000 800 80% 
1500 1600 100% 
2000 2000 100% 
1000 0 0% 
1200 1200 100% 
1000 900 90% 
 
Repayment Rate of the bank =( ( 800  + 1600  + 2000  + 0  + 1200 + 900) / (1000 + 1500 + 
2000  + 1000  + 1200  + 1000)) * 100 
= (6500 / 7700)*100  
= 84.14% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
On-Time Repayment Rate (OTR): 
On-Time Repayment (OTR) Rate is a key performance metric in microfinance that 
measures the percentage of loan installments that are paid by borrowers on or before their 
scheduled due date. 
OTR Rate=(Number of On-Time Payments  / Total Scheduled Payments)×100 
Where: 
• Number of On-Time Payments: The count of payments made on or before their 
due dates. 
• Total Scheduled Payments: The total number of payments that were due within 
the reporting period. 
Example: 
Let’s Calculate the OTR of the month Nov-2024. 
10 | Page 
 
➢ Total Scheduled Payments: 1,000 
➢ On-Time Payments: 950 
➢ Late Payments (before month-end): 5 (not included in on-time payments) 
➢ Missed Payments (No payments regarding Demand): 45 
 
OTR = (950 / 1000) * 100 = 95%

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Operating Self-Sufficiency (OSS): 
Operating Self Sufficiency (OSS) shows the sufficiency of income (operating income and 
investment income) earned by MLIs(Micro Lending institutions) to cover the cost like 
operating cost, loan loss provision and finance cost, incurred for conducting the 
operations. 
 
OSS = (Total Operating Income / Total Operating Expenses) * 100 
Where: 
• Total Operating Income: Includes revenue from loan interest, fees, and other 
financial services offered by the MFI. 
• Total Operating Expenses: Comprises all expenses, such as: 
o Loan loss provisions (to cover bad debts). 
o Financial costs (e.g., interest on borrowed funds). 
11 | Page 
 
o Administrative and personnel expenses. 
Interpretation: 
1. OSS ≥ 100%: 
a. The MFI is operationally self-sufficient, meaning it can cover all expenses 
with its income. 
b. Indicates financial sustainability. 
2. OSS < 100%: 
a. The MFI is not covering its costs fully and may rely on subsidies, grants, or 
external funding to sustain operations. 
b. Indicates the need for efficiency improvements or income enhancement. 
 
Example: 
Month Total Operating 
Income 
Total Operating Expenses 
 
OSS 
Sep-2024 10000 9000 111% 
Oct-2024 9000 9500 94.73% 
Nov-2024 10000 10000 100% 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Loyalty Rate: 
Loyalty Rate in microfinance is a metric that measures the proportion of borrowers who 
remain with the microfinance institution (MFI) over time by taking repeat loans. 
Loyalty Rate = (Number of Clients Who Took Repeat Loans after closing the loans in that 
specific time frame /  Loan closures during the specific time period exclude Pre-closure) 
*100 
Example: 
Active Loans at the End of the Year: 1,000 (not directly relevant to the loyalty rate 
calculation). 
Clients Whose Loans Closed During the Year: 100 
Clients Who Took Repeat Loans: 20 
Loyalty Rate =( 20 / 100 ) *100 =20% 
12 | Page 
 
 
** Cumulative Loyalty Rate = (Total Repeat customer from as on closed loans / As on date 
total closed loans)*100 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Active Borrower Per Credit Officer (ABCO) / Case Load: 
Active Borrower Per Credit Officer (ABCO), also known as Case Load, is a key metric in the 
microfinance and lending industry that measures the workload of a credit officer by 
assessing the number of active borrowers they are managing. 
ABCO= (Total Number of Active Borrowers / Total Number of Credit Officers) 
Example: 
Month over Month Case Load: 
Month Active Borrowers Credit Officers Case Load 
Jan-2024 10000 50 200 
Feb-2024 12000 50 240 
Mar-2024 15000 55 273 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Average Loan Size (ALS) / Average Ticket Size (ATS): 
Refers to the average amount of loans disbursed to borrowers by the MFI within a specific 
period. 
Average Loan Size (ALS) / Average Ticket Size (ATS)= Total Loan Amount Disbursed / 
Number of Loans Disbursed 
 Example: 
Month over Month ATS: 
Month Total Amount Disbursed No of Loan Disbursed ATS 
Jan-2024 160000 4 40000 
Feb-2024 1470000 42 35000 
Mar-2024 1800000 60 30000

Loan Write-off 
Loan Write-off in microfinance refers to the process of officially removing a loan from the 
books of a microfinance institution (MFI) when it is deemed uncollectible. This typically 
occurs when a loan is considered as a bad debt or is unlikely to be repaid by the borrower. 
A loan write-off does not mean the borrower is absolved of the debt, but rather that the MFI 
recognizes the loan as a loss for accounting and reporting purposes. 
Key Points of Loan Write-off in Microfinance: 
1. Accounting Treatment: A loan write-off involves reducing the outstanding loan 
balance on the MFI’s balance sheet. This helps the MFI reflect the actual value of its 
loan portfolio, which is important for financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and 
investor confidence. 
2. Impact on Borrowers: The borrower remains legally responsible for repaying the 
loan, even if it has been written off. In many cases, the borrower may continue to 
repay the debt, or the MFI may attempt to recover the amount through legal 
channels. 
3. Write-off Criteria: The decision to write off a loan is usually made when: 
a. The loan is severely overdue and it is unlikely that repayment will occur (e.g., 
after a significant number of missed payments, typically 180 days or more). 
b. The borrower has defaulted and no further collection efforts or negotiations 
are likely to succeed. 
c. The loan is deemed uncollectible after all recovery efforts, such as 
restructuring or rescheduling, have been exhausted. 
4. Not the Same as Forgiveness: A loan write-off is different from loan forgiveness. 
Loan forgiveness means that the borrower is legally relieved of the obligation to 
repay the loan. In contrast, a write-off only removes the loan from the institution’s 
financial records but does not absolve the borrower of their debt. 
5. Regulatory and Financial Reporting: Financial regulators often require MFIs to 
maintain certain levels of provisions for loan losses based on their loan write-off 
experience. These write-offs impact the MFI’s profitability and capital adequacy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loan Settlement 
• Definition: 
Loan settlement occurs when the borrower negotiates with the lender to pay a 
portion of the loan amount (less than the full amount owed) as a final resolution to 
settle the debt. 
• Key Features: 
o The borrower and lender agree on a reduced repayment amount. 
o Once the agreed amount is paid, the remaining debt is forgiven, and no 
further repayment is required. 
o Settlement is usually considered when the borrower is facing genuine 
financial difficulties and is unable to repay the full amount. 
• Impact on Credit Score: 
o The settlement is reported to credit bureaus as a "settled" account and 
negatively impacts the borrower’s credit score, though typically less severe 
than a complete default. 
• Reason for Settlement: 
o Done Borrower's Genuine Financial Distress 
▪ Borrowers, often from low-income groups, may face unexpected 
hardships like health emergencies, natural disasters, job losses, or 
crop failures. 
o Avoiding Complete Loan Default 
▪ By settling, the MFI recovers at least a portion of the loan rather than 
writing it off as a total loss. 
o Maintaining Client Relationships 
▪ Settlement may help preserve goodwill with borrowers who might 
return for future loans when their financial situation improves. 
o Cost of Recovery Efforts 
▪ Pursuing legal or collection efforts against low-income borrowers can 
be expensive and counterproductive for MFIs. 
o Regulatory or Policy Pressure 
▪ Governments or regulators may encourage settlements for struggling 
borrowers to prevent widespread financial distress in vulnerable 
populations. 
o Social Responsibility 
▪ Many MFIs have a dual objective of financial sustainability and social 
impact. Helping borrowers in distress aligns with their mission to 
support economic stability in underprivileged communities. 
o Mitigating Portfolio Risk 
▪ High levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) can threaten an MFI's 
financial health and ability to secure funding. 
o External Factors 
15 | Page 
 
▪ Events like pandemics, economic downturns, or natural disasters 
may lead to widespread inability to repay loans. 
Key Differences 
Aspect Loan Write-off Loan Settlement 
Definition 
Lender removes the loan from its 
books as a loss but continues to seek 
repayment. 
Borrower and lender agree on a 
reduced amount to settle the loan. 
Obligation Borrower still owes the full loan 
amount. 
Borrower is no longer obligated 
after paying the agreed settlement 
amount. 
Reason Accounting measure for bad debts. Negotiation due to borrower’s 
inability to pay in full. 
Impact on 
Credit 
Marked as "written-off," significantly 
lowering credit score. 
Marked as "settled," also lowering 
credit score but slightly less 
severe. 
Lender’s 
Recovery 
May pursue repayment via legal or 
collection actions. 
No further action after settlement 
payment. 
Negotiation No negotiation; lender decides 
unilaterally. 
Involves negotiation between 
lender and borrower. 
 
Which is Better for the Borrower? 
Loan Write-off: Provides no relief to the borrower and negatively affects credit. 
Loan Settlement: Offers partial relief but also affects creditworthiness. Settlement is 
preferable if you want to close the debt with a reduced amount. 
Conclusion 
A write-off is an internal accounting decision by the lender, while a settlement is an 
agreement between the borrower and the lender to partially resolve the debt. Both impact 
credit scores and borrowing capacity negatively.
